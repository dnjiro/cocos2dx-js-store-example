# cocos2dx-js-store-example

**cocos2dx-js-store-example** is an example project demonstrating usage and implementation of SOOMLA's [cocos2dx-store](http://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-store).

This project contains examples for implementing all of SOOMLA's interfaces and using SOOMLA's various services. Read up on what you can do with SOOMLA in this [wiki](https://github.com/soomla/android-store/wiki) (the wiki is for Android but it applies to all the projects under The SOOMLA Project).

## Getting started

1. Obtain the Cocos2d-js framework either from [git](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-js) or from the [Cocos2d-x website](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/download). Make sure to use the latest **stable** version (v3.3 as of Mar 31 2015).

2. Download and install Cocos IDE (http://www.cocos2d-x.org/download).


3. Recursively clone this project to the workspace folder of Cocos IDE.
    ```
    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-js-store-example.git
    ```

4. Export this project to workspace of Cocos IDE.

#### Build instructions for Android

1. Build Custom Sumulator for Android in Cocos IDE.

Take a look around, and get a feel for all you can do with cocos2dx-store.

#### Build instructions for iOS

1. In order to proceed we need to know, where your cocos2d-x is. Please, create a symlink with `cocos2d-x` at the path `frameworks/runtime-src` of the project, which looks at `cocos2d-x`. It can be something like that:

```
ln -s <your-cocos2d-js-path>/frameworks/js-bindings/cocos2d-x frameworks/runtime-src/cocos2d-x
```

2. Build Custom Sumulator for iOS in Cocos IDE.

Take a look around, and get a feel for all you can do with cocos2dx-store.

#### IStoreAssets

A good example of how to define an economy model can be found in [MuffinRushAssets](https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-js-store-example/blob/master/Resources/src/MuffinRushAssets.js).

Take a look at that file and see how you can define your specific game's economy.

#### Scenes

This project contains three main scenes: MainScene, StoreAScene, and StoreBScene. They are all built with [*CocosBuilder*](http://cocosbuilder.com/)
- **MainScene**: serves as an entry point to the store, use it as a reference how to enter the store in your app.
- **StoreAScene**: contains all of the PurchaseWithVirtualItem items and allows the user to buy them.
- **StoreBScene**: contains all of the PurchaseWithMarket items and allows the user to buy them.
